# Operating System Navi

![Navi the Fairy]()

Operating systems are full of obscure files and directories which configure the system.
This repo is designed to mirror an operating systems file directory but in the place of each file, explain what the file does and how to use it.
If you have a question about an OS which is not represented here you might still find the answer in the Gentoo folder which might have the answer to your question.

### Conventions
- In each directory, there is a `README.md` which explains the purpose of this folder but not necessarily the files in the folder.
- File and directory names are maintained exactly so that you can easily locate a file that you want to know more about. The contents of the file will not be valid for a normal operating system since it will be full of explanation.
