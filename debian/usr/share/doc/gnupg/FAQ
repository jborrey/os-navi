GnuPG Frequently Asked Questions

A FAQ is a fast moving target and thus we don't distribute it anymore
with GnuPG.  You may retrieve the current FAQ in HTML format at

  http://www.gnupg.org/faq/GnuPG-FAQ.html

or in plain text format at the FTP server:

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/GnuPG-FAQ.txt
