liblocale-gettext-perl for Debian
---------------------------------

This module is used to internationalize all Perl programs in the
same way than the C programs. You only need to create *.mo file in order
to translate your Perl program if you used the gettext functions where
strings were needed.

The man page is not very instructive, take a look at the README file
shipped in the /usr/share/doc/liblocale-gettext-perl directory.
